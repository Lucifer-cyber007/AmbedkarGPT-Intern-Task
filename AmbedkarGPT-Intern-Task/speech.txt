I am indeed happy that the Constitution has been finally passed by this Assembly. I feel, however, that in a sense we are all of us unhappy over this passing away of the Constitution. But we must face the facts. It is not possible to frame a Constitution which is going to satisfy everybody. We have, however, tried our best to frame a Constitution which will be as acceptable to as many people as possible.

We have provided for the machinery to work the Constitution. The Constitution itself is only a skeleton. The flesh and blood must be added by the people, by the legislature, by the executive. The Constitution is only a mechanism to set up a machinery. It is not a machine by itself. It is for the people to make it work, to run it, and to make it serve the purpose for which it has been framed.

However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it happen to be a good lot. The Constitution, like a machine, is lifeless. It acquires life because of the men who control it and operate it, and India needs nothing more than a set of good men to work the Constitution. If you have good men, it does not matter if the Constitution is bad. If you have bad men, it does not matter how good the Constitution is.

I feel that the Constitution is workable; it is flexible and it is strong enough to hold the country together both in peacetime and in wartime. Indeed, if I may adopt the words of the famous English judge, the Constitution is “what the judges say it is”. And the Constitution is what we make of it.

Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil which is essentially undemocratic. In our social and economic structure, there are glaring inequalities. They have grown because of our long social tradition. We must remove these inequalities as speedily as possible. We cannot afford to have equality in political life and inequality in social and economic life. If we do that, those who suffer from inequality may blow up the structure of political democracy.

On the 26th of January, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics, we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics, we will be recognizing the principle of 'one man one vote and one vote one value'. In our social and economic life, we will be continuing to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?

We must remove this contradiction at the earliest moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of democracy which this Constituent Assembly has so laboriously built up.

If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? We must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. When there was no way left for constitutional methods, there was a great deal of justification for those who wished to overthrow the state. But where constitutional methods are available, there can be no justification for unconstitutional methods. That, I think, is the first thing we must do to maintain democracy.

The second thing we must do is to observe the caution which John Stuart Mill has given to all who are interested in the maintenance of democracy: namely, not to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man. There is nothing wrong in being grateful to great men who render service to the country. But in India, bhakti or hero worship plays a part in our politics unequalled in magnitude. Bhakti in religion may be the road to the salvation of the soul. But in politics, bhakti or hero worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.

The third thing we must do is not be content with mere political democracy. We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. A political democracy without social democracy is at best precarious. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality, and fraternity as the principles of life.

Let us cherish and uphold these principles. Let us resolve to build a nation where justice, liberty, equality and fraternity are not mere words, but guiding principles of our collective life. Only then can the Constitution serve its true purpose and ensure the progress of the nation.
